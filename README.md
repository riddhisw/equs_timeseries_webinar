# Measurement Noise Filtering & Time-Series Prediction in Python

Support Materials for EQUS webinar "Measurement Noise Filtering &amp; Time-Series Prediction in Python" (24/09/2019) presented by Riddhi Gupta. 


#### Purpose:

The purpose of this webinar is to introduce techniques for time series analysis. In this webinar, I focus on the (linear) state space framework and the different ways we can use this framework to do **state estimation**, **noise filtering**, and **prediction** with time series data. These terms will be defined in due course. I assume no prior experience with time series analysis.

#### Repo Contents:

In this git repo, the main document follows the webinar presentation and is contained in:

    Measurement Noise Filtering and Time Series Prediction in Python_v4.ipynb

In this repo, the supporting Python codebase contains the following files, each of which comprise of a list of standalone Python functions:

    time_series_analysis_demo.py : 
        Contains the main state estimation, filtering and prediction algorithm.
    
    chirp_models.py :
        Contains functions to produce linear and geometric chirp signals. 
        

Examples in Section 3.3 of the Jupyter workbook requires access to the following Kalman Filtering Python packages: **akf, kf.** from outside of this repo. These packages can be downloaded from https://github.com/riddhisw/predictiveest/tree/riddhisw-webinar/. If the **akf** and **kf** packages are not available, then set *RUN_RESTRICTED* variable in notebook to:

    RUN_RESTRICTED = True

The codebase is written in Python 2.7 and is also Python 3.X compatible in division, print_function and and absolute import usage.
